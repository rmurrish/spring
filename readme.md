# Spring Pages

## This is the development branch of Spring.red
Updates happen here, and get compiled down to what goes into the gh-pages branch.

## Org

articles_draft is where drafts go. When finished, move to articles folder.

'live' is where the generated content goes.

'static' is where site-wide content goes. Images, css, etc.
